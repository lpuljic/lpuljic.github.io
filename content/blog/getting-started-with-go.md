## Why Go?

- **Simple syntax** - Easy to read and learn
- **Fast compilation** - Compiles directly to machine code
- **Built-in concurrency** - Goroutines make concurrent programming accessible
- **Strong standard library** - Rich set of built-in packages
- **Single binary deployment** - No runtime dependencies

## Your First Program

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
